## Detailed experience

I have extensive experience with python, including heavy use of some core packages to scientific computing such as numpy, scipy and matplotlib. I have also experience in creating tkinter and matplotlib based graphical user interfaces (GUIs) for real time data visualization and manipulation.

I have also some experience in c++ and java acquired while developing an Android application for automatic medicine recognition.

I list below a description of some of the core packages that I have developed and that I plan to make public on my [github page](https://github.com/AfonsoV) in the near future.

# My codes

* SpectroPhotometric Visualization Tool (SPVT)

* Morphological Visualization Tool (MVT)

* Python package for galaxy morphology (astromorph)

* Python package for data visualization in astronomy (matplotastro)

* General utilities for astronomy (collection of functions and scripts)
