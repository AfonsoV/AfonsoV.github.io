# Jobs

`_Position_` : Postdoctoral researcher

_Location_ : Leiden Observatory, Netherlands

_Date_: Jan. 2018 - present

_Description_: N/A

_Position_ : Postdoctoral researcher

_Location_ : Centro de Computação Gráfica, Guimarães, Portugal

_Date_: Feb. 2017 - Dec. 2017

_Description_: Developed an Android application for automatic medicine recognition from the video feed of the device. This application applied 4 stages for successful recognition: box detection - barcode detection - text detection - feature detection. It makes use of libraries such as OpenCV (for general computer vision tasks), Tesseract (for optical character recognition) and ZBar (for barcode detection).

_Position_ : Research assistant

_Location_ : Centro de Astrofísica da Universidade do Porto, Portugal

_Date_: Jan. 2012 - Dec. 2012

_Description_: Developed a FORTRAN code with OpenMP implementation to compute the two-point correlation function (TPCF) from a galaxy catalog compiled in the context of the global project "The Bulgeless Side of Galaxy Evolution" based on AEGIS, COSMOS, GEMS and GOODS data. The TPCF was calculated for various groups of galaxies (grouped according to their physical properties) to assess the clustering dependence on physical properties. All the data analysis of the correlation functions was done using python language.

_Position_ : Research assistant

_Location_ : Centro de Astrofísica da Universidade do Porto, Portugal

_Date_: Nov. 2009 - Oct. 2010

_Description_: Developed skills on how to run and analyze data from numerical N-body+SPH simulations using the publicly available _gadget_ and _hydra_ codes. Creation of a simple code in FORTRAN to generate the initial conditions for a spherical collapse. Comparison of the results (density-temperature phase-space diagrams, mass-temperature relations for simulated clusters, density and temperature profiles for the case study of the spherical collapse) from both codes given the same initial conditions. All data analysis of the simulation results was done using IDL.

# Education

### PhD

I got my PhD degree in Astrophysics and Cosmology from [Aix-Marseille Universitè](https://sciences.univ-amu.fr/) and worked at the [Laboratoire d'Astrophysique de Marseille (LAM)](https://www.lam.fr/?lang=fr).

I was supervised by Prof. Olivier Le Fèvre, and my work focused on studying the morphological properties (both quantitative and qualitative) of the UV light of star-forming galaxies at 2<z<6 observed within the [VIMOS Ultra Deep Survey (VUDS)](http://cesam.oamp.fr/vuds/). I also studied the shapes of the Lyman-\alpha emission as seen from the 2D slit spectra. have also participated in the preparation of the public data releases.

### MSc.

I obtained my Masters degree in Astronomy from [Universidade do Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/pt/web_page.inicial), with my dissertation being developed at the [Centro de Astrofísica da Universidade do Porto](https://www.astro.up.pt/) under the supervision of Prof. Catarina Lobo and Dr. Sonia Anton. In my master thesis I explored the 2D structure of a sample of nearby massive bulgeless galaxies and correlated their morphology with spectroscopically derived parameters of their central regions obtained from SDSS fiber spectra.

### BSC.

I obtained my Bachelor degree in Astronomy from [Universidade do Porto](https://sigarra.up.pt/fcup/pt/web_page.inicial).
