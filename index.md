 I guess if you are here you already know my name. I am currently working as a Postdoctoral researcher at [Leiden Observatory] on Rychard Bouwens' team. My main focus of research is to study the early stages of galaxy evolution in general, with a special focus on galaxy morphology. I have also a strong interest in developing code for astronomy and interactive data  visualization ([check my Coding page](developed-codes)).
